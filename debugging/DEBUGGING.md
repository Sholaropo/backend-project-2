# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: Delete Employee

- **Breakpoint Location:** dist\src\api\v1\controllers\employee.js Line 30
- **Objective:** Trying to understand the employee delete process

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  req.params.id: Employee ID to be deleted
  isEmployeeDeleted: Boolean indicating deletion success
- **Call Stack:**
  DELETE /api/v1/employees/:id endpoint
  employeesController.delete
  employeesService.delete
  Mongoose delete operation
- **Behavior:**
  Controller receives delete request with employee ID
  Calls service layer to perform deletion
  Returns 204 status on success with no content
  No response if deletion fails

### Analysis

- Soft delete is not implemented - records are permanently removed
- Missing error handling for non-existent IDs
- Add soft delete functionality

## Scenario 2: Create Branch

- **Breakpoint Location:** dist\src\api\v1\controllers\branch.js Line 8
- **Objective:** Trying to understand branch create flow

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  req.body: Contains branch creation data (name, address, phone)
  branch: Newly created branch object
  res.statusCode: 201 for successful creation
- **Call Stack:**
  POST /api/v1/branches endpoint
  branchesController.create
  branchesService.create
  Mongoose create operation
- **Behavior:**
  Validates incoming branch data
  Creates new branch document in MongoDB
  Returns created branch with generated ID
  Transforms response to remove MongoDB-specific fields

### Analysis

- Schema validation happens at MongoDB level
- Auto-generation of MongoDB id fields
- No duplicate branch name checking
- Add proper error handling for validation failures

## Scenario 3: GET employees by branch id

- **Breakpoint Location:** dist\src\api\v1\controllers\employee.js Line 35
- **Objective:** Trying to understand how fetching employees by branch id works

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  req.params.branchId: Branch ID for filtering
  employees: Array of employee objects
  decodedDepartment: URL-decoded department name
- **Call Stack:**
  GET /api/v1/employees/branch/:branchId endpoint
  employeesController.getByBranch
  employeesService.getByBranch
  Mongoose find operation
- **Behavior:**
  Receives branch ID from URL parameters
  Queries employee collection with branch filter
  Returns array of matching employees
  Transforms each employee document

### Analysis

- Relationship between employees and branches is maintained by reference
- Response includes full employee details
- No pagination implemented
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Need for improved error handling and validation
