# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: Creating a New Branch

- **Breakpoint Location:** branchController.ts, line 53: `const newBranch: Branch = await branchService.createBranch(req.body);`
- **Objective:** Analyze the branch creation process and validate request data handling

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `req.body`: `{ name: "Downtown Branch", address: "123 Main St", phone: "555-0123" }`
  - `newBranch`: `{ id: "1707926841253", name: "Downtown Branch", address: "123 Main St", phone: "555-0123" }`

- **Call Stack:**
  - createBranch (branchController.ts)
  - Express middleware handler
  - Router dispatch

- **Behavior:**
  - Request body is received and parsed
  - Service generates timestamp-based ID
  - New branch object is stored in memory array

### Analysis

- **Key Learnings:**
  - Request data flows smoothly through controller to service layer
  - In-memory storage means data is temporary
  - ID generation uses timestamp method

- **Unexpected Behaviors:**
  - No validation on required fields
  - No duplicate check for branch names
  - No data persistence implementation

- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Add input validation middleware
  - Implement proper database storage
  - Use UUID instead of timestamp for IDs

This debugging session reveals that while the basic CRUD functionality works, the system needs additional validation and persistent storage implementation.


## Scenario 2: Deleting an Employee

- **Breakpoint Location:** employeeController.ts, line 137: `await employeeService.deleteEmployee(req.params.id);`
- **Objective:** Analyze the employee deletion process and error handling

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `req.params.id`: "1707926841253"
  - `index`: -1 (when employee not found) or 2 (when employee exists)

- **Call Stack:**
  - deleteEmployee (employeeController.ts)
  - Express middleware handler
  - Router dispatch

- **Behavior:**
  - Receives employee ID from request parameters
  - Service layer checks employee existence
  - If found, removes from array; if not, throws error

### Analysis

- **Key Learnings:**
  - Deletion process relies on array index finding
  - Error handling catches non-existent employee IDs
  - Response maintains consistent format

- **Unexpected Behaviors:**
  - No soft delete option available
  - No cascade deletion for related records
  - No audit trail of deletions

- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Implement soft delete functionality
  - Add deletion confirmation step
  - Log deletion operations

# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 3: Getting Employees by Branch ID

- **Breakpoint Location:** employeeController.ts, line 53: `const employees: Employee[] = await employeeService.getEmployeesByBranch(req.params.branchId);`
- **Objective:** Analyze how employees are filtered by branch ID

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:**
  - `req.params.branchId`: "branch123"
  - `employees`: `[{id: "1", name: "John", branchId: "branch123"}, ...]`

- **Call Stack:**
  - getEmployeesByBranch (employeeController.ts)
  - Express middleware handler
  - Router dispatch

- **Behavior:**
  - Receives branch ID from request parameters
  - Filters employee array based on branchId match
  - Returns filtered array of employees

### Analysis

- **Key Learnings:**
  - Filter operation is case-sensitive
  - Returns empty array if no matches
  - No validation of branch existence

- **Unexpected Behaviors:**
  - No pagination implementation
  - No sorting capabilities
  - Returns all matches without limit

- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Add pagination support
  - Validate branch existence
  - Add sorting and filtering options
